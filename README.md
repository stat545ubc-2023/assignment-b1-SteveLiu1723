Hi everyone, I am Zefan, and here is the repository for my Homework B1 of STAT545B.

In this homework, I designed a function to count the number of outliers in each column of a given dataframe. Both md format and Rmd format of the description of the function are included in this repository, and you can find them easily.

Hope this function can be helpful!
